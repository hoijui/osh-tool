# Checks

| Name | Weight | Openness | Hardware | Quality | Machine-Readability | Description | Why | Source Code |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Clean electronics files | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the contained Electronics blueprint files - <br/>Schematics and PCB designs - <br/>if any, <br/>use an open format, <br/>are text-based <br/>and are actual source files (vs generated). | - open format:<br/>  This is good for collaboration:<br/>  It is legal and technically easier to create viewers and editors,<br/>  and it is much more likley that there already are or will be viewers and editors<br/>  for such formats,<br/>  which are free themselfs.<br/>- text-based:<br/>  This is good for versioning with a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control),<br/>  e.g. git,<br/>  which makes collaborating and sharing of a design easier.<br/>- source files:<br/>  This is required for being Open **Source** in the first place. | [`clean_electronics_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/clean_electronics_files.nim) |
| REUSE Licensing info | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.30 | 1.00 | Checks that complete SPDX licensing info is given <br/>for all files in the project. <br/>We do this using the Free Software Foundations REUSE tool.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is related to the License exists check. | Copyright and licensing is difficult,<br/>especially when reusing software from different projects<br/>that are released under various different licenses.<br/>[REUSE](https://reuse.software/) was started by<br/>the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) (FSFE)<br/>to provide a set of recommendations to make licensing your Free Software projects easier.<br/>Not only do these recommendations make it easier for you<br/>to declare the licenses under which your works are released,<br/>but they also make it easier for a computer<br/>to understand how your project is licensed.<br/><br/>Propper licensing information may prevent or help in potential legal disputes.<br/>It also helps anyone using your source or derivates of it,<br/>to understand their rights.<br/> | [`reuse_lint.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/reuse_lint.nim) |
| No sources in root | 0.10 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 0.00 | Checks that no source files appear in the root dir of the project. <br/>Make sure to put them all into sub-directories, for example `src/`. | Makes the Repo look more clean and more friendly,<br/>especially for non-coding people<br/>that might just wnat to browse or edit the documentation. | [`no_sources_in_root.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_sources_in_root.nim) |
| OKH manifest content | 0.70 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Checks that the OKH manifest file - <br/>which contains project meta-data - <br/>contains at least the required properties, <br/>and that all properties use the correct format. | This makes the project much more easily comparable,<br/>both for humans and machines/software.<br/><br/>This is useful when dealing with a lot of projects,<br/>to not waste life- or processing-time,<br/>trying to figure out a certain,<br/>commonly useful set of properties about a project. | [`okh_lint.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/okh_lint.nim) |
| No global links to local files | 0.40 | 0.80 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 0.80 | Checks no links to project local files use a 'global' prefix,<br/>be it a web-hosting URL or an absolute local path. | This is a step towards a documentation that is:<br/><br/>- locally browsable an editable without internet connection<br/>- showing and linking to the actual, local, correct content | [`no_global_links_to_local_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_global_links_to_local_files.nim) |
| No space in file names | 0.40 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 1.00 | Checks that no file-names in the project contain white-space. | This makes automatic processing of all the projects files<br/>much easier and less error-prone. | [`no_space_in_file_names.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_space_in_file_names.nim) |
| Uses dir standard | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.30 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Checks whether the unixish OSH directory standard is used <br/>for a sufficient amount of files and directories in the project, <br/>using the osh-dir-std CLI tool. | 1. to be able to extract meta-data:<br/>    1. easy indexing (and thus finding) of projects<br/>    2. easy comparing of projects<br/>    3. allows to write software tools that deal with project repos<br/>2. find your way around quickly and easily in different projects | [`uses_dir_std.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/uses_dir_std.nim) |
| README exists | 0.20 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.10 | 0.50 | Checks that a README file exists in the projects root dir, <br/>using the regex `(?i)^.*README.*$`. | A README file is the main entry point for a human that comes along the project,<br/>and wants to figure out what it is about, and how to use it.<br/><br/>It is targeted at all potential stakeholders of the project,<br/>be it designers, manufacturers, sellers, repairers or users.<br/><br/>We might think of it as the most essential,<br/>basic part of the documentation of the project. | [`readme_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/readme_exists.nim) |
| OKH file exists | 0.70 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the OKH manifest file - <br/>which contains project meta-data - <br/>exists. | If this is actually a hardware project,<br/>the existence of this file clearly and unmistakingly marks it as such,<br/>both for humans and machines/software.<br/><br/>This is useful when dealing with a lot of projects,<br/>to not waste life- or processing-time,<br/>which likely would still be less exact in its findings. | [`okh_file_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/okh_file_exists.nim) |
| LICENSE exists | 0.20 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.05 | 1.00 | Checks that a LICENSE file exists in the projects root dir, <br/>using the regex `(?i)^.*(LICEN[SC]E|COPYING).*$`.<br/>Note that this is related to the REUSE lint check. | Before REUSE, this was the standard (and only) way<br/>to declare which license(s) are used within the project.<br/>While REUSE is in all ways superior to this approach,<br/>Many platforms and softwares still purely rely on this way<br/>to automatically detect the license(s) of a project.<br/>We thus recommend to keep the "main"<br/>(according ot your subjective decission)<br/>license of the project in such a file,<br/>by first fixing REUSE for the project,<br/>and then running a command similar to:<br/>`cp LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0.txt LICENSE.txt` | [`license_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/license_exists.nim) |
| Clean CAD files | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the Mechanical design files - <br/>Computer Aided Design (CAD) files - <br/>if any, <br/>use an open format, <br/>are text-based <br/>and are actual source files (vs generated). | - open format:<br/>  This is good for collaboration:<br/>  It is legal and technically easier to create viewers and editors,<br/>  and it is much more likley that there already are or will be viewers and editors<br/>  for such formats,<br/>  which are free themselfs.<br/>- text-based:<br/>  This is good for versioning with a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control),<br/>  e.g. git,<br/>  which makes collaborating and sharing of a design easier.<br/>- source files:<br/>  This is required for being Open **Source** in the first place. | [`clean_cad_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/clean_cad_files.nim) |
| No generated files | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.30 | Checks that no generated files are part of the project. <br/>These are usually files that are created using a software <br/>that is manually configured and executed by a human. <br/>Try instead, to find a way to automate this process, <br/>and to not store the resulting files in the repository. | 1. The projects storage requirements go down - <br/>usually by a lot<br/>2. There are no outdated generated files,<br/>    because of either of these two reasons:<br/><br/>    - One only gets the files hwen generating them right when required, or<br/>    - They are regenerated in CI/build-bot and uploaded/hosted on the project pages<br/>      whenever there is a change (e.g. a git push to to the repo)<br/><br/>NOTE: This is one of the more controversial checks,<br/>as it often requires writing new software.<br/>That is sometimes a simple script,<br/>and sometimes complex software requiring many person-months of development. | [`no_generated_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_generated_files.nim) |
| No unwanted files | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.30 | Checks that no unwanted files are part of the project. <br/>These could be backups, caches, IDE/platform specific, and so on. | These files, present in the repo, could cause these issues and inconvieniences:<br/><br/>- potentially inflating the repositories size<br/>- mess up local settings (e.g. local cache paths of an IDE) by one designer<br/>  on an other deginers machine<br/>- make the project appear less clean<br/>- make the project maintainers look like amateurs to seasoned Open Source people<br/>- confuse people, as they are around, yet seem to have no usefulness | [`unwanted_files_exist_not.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/unwanted_files_exist_not.nim) |

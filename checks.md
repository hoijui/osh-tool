# Checks

| IDs | Name | Weight | Openness | Hardware | Quality | Machine-Readability | Description | Why | Source Code |
| --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| bom_exists | BoM exists | 0.20 | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.30 | 0.60 | Checks that a Bill of Materials (BoM) file exists in the projects root dir, <br/>using the regex `(?i)^(BoM\|BillOfMaterials\|Bill_of_Materials\|Bill-of-Materials).*$`. | A BoM file contains a list of all required parts,<br/>be that raw parts or ready-made ones.<br/>That not only clearly marks the repository as a hardware project,<br/>but also allows for quick human (and partly machine/software)<br/>based analysis for what is needed to build the piece of hardware,<br/>and to have at east a first rought idea about the costs,<br/>and potential candidates that could become a supply problem.<br/><br/>... plus probably many other uses. | [`bom_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/bom_exists.nim) |
| clean_cad_files | Clean CAD files | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the Mechanical design files - <br/>Computer Aided Design (CAD) files - <br/>if any, <br/>use an open format, <br/>are text-based <br/>and are actual source files (vs generated). | - open format:<br/>  This is good for collaboration:<br/>  It is legal and technically easier to create viewers and editors,<br/>  and it is much more likley that there already are or will be viewers and editors<br/>  for such formats,<br/>  which are free themselfs.<br/>- text-based:<br/>  This is good for versioning with a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control),<br/>  e.g. git,<br/>  which makes collaborating and sharing of a design easier.<br/>- source files:<br/>  This is required for being Open **Source** in the first place. | [`clean_cad_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/clean_cad_files.nim) |
| clean_electronics_files | Clean electronics files | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the contained Electronics blueprint files - <br/>Schematics and PCB designs - <br/>if any, <br/>use an open format, <br/>are text-based <br/>and are actual source files (vs generated). | - open format:<br/>  This is good for collaboration:<br/>  It is legal and technically easier to create viewers and editors,<br/>  and it is much more likley that there already are or will be viewers and editors<br/>  for such formats,<br/>  which are free themselfs.<br/>- text-based:<br/>  This is good for versioning with a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control),<br/>  e.g. git,<br/>  which makes collaborating and sharing of a design easier.<br/>- source files:<br/>  This is required for being Open **Source** in the first place. | [`clean_electronics_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/clean_electronics_files.nim) |
| license_exists | LICENSE exists | 0.20 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.05 | 1.00 | Checks that a LICENSE file exists in the projects root dir, <br/>using the regex `(?i)^.*(LICEN[SC]E\|COPYING).*$`.<br/>Note that this is related to the REUSE lint check. | Before REUSE, this was the standard (and only) way<br/>to declare which license(s) are used within the project.<br/>While REUSE is in all ways superior to this approach,<br/>Many platforms and softwares still purely rely on this way<br/>to automatically detect the license(s) of a project.<br/>We thus recommend to keep the "main"<br/>(according ot your subjective decission)<br/>license of the project in such a file,<br/>by first fixing REUSE for the project,<br/>and then running a command similar to:<br/>`cp LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0.txt LICENSE.txt` | [`license_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/license_exists.nim) |
| markdown_lint | Markdown content | 0.50 | 0.90 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Checks that the content of all Markdown files in the repository<br/>adheres to a strict set of syntax rules for that format. | Markdown exists in many different varieties.<br/>There is mostly one original format (simply: "Markdown"),<br/>which has very loose syntax rules,<br/>and which nobody uses anymore,<br/>because it can be unclear what was meant to be expressed<br/>(format wise).<br/>Then there are all the derivatives,<br/>which are not fully compatible amongst each other.<br/>Examples for these are:<br/><br/>* CommonMark (Close)<br/>* Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)<br/>* GitLab Markdown (very similar to the above)<br/>* Pandoc Markdown<br/><br/>CommonMark has the same, limited set of features like the original Markdown,<br/>but is very strict with regards to what is valid and what not.<br/>This is good, because it means, that if you adhere to this set of rules,<br/>__your Markdown will be correctly interpreted whereever Markdown is accepted__<br/><br/>Most other Markdown flavors -<br/>like the other three above -<br/>have extended the original set of features,<br/>and try to guess what the user wanted to express,<br/>even if they did not use correct syntax.<br/>To rely on this though, makes ones Markdown less portable,<br/>and thus in a way, kind of inflicts a soft lock-in<br/>on systems supporting such heuristics. | [`markdown_lint.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/markdown_lint.nim) |
| markup_link | Markup link check | 0.70 | 0.90 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 0.60 | Checks whether links in Markdown and HTML documents <br/>in the repo are pointing to something valid. | Links are often put in by project maintainers once<br/>and then they forget about them.<br/>Due to the dynamic nature of the web,<br/>links become defunct over time,<br/>which of course hurts the quality of the documentation<br/>and the experience the users have, browsing it.<br/><br/>This is especially important and freuqent<br/>in regards to repo-internal links.<br/><br/>This check brings the attention of this issue<br/>back to the repo maintainers,<br/>without having to rely on users<br/>reporting each link individually. | [`markup_link.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/markup_link.nim) |
| no_generated_files | No generated files | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.30 | Checks that no generated files are part of the project. <br/>These are usually files that are created using a software <br/>that is manually configured and executed by a human. <br/>Try instead, to find a way to automate this process, <br/>and to not store the resulting files in the repository. | 1. The projects storage requirements go down - <br/>usually by a lot<br/>2. There are no outdated generated files,<br/>    because of either of these two reasons:<br/><br/>    - One only gets the files hwen generating them right when required, or<br/>    - They are regenerated in CI/build-bot and uploaded/hosted on the project pages<br/>      whenever there is a change (e.g. a git push to to the repo)<br/><br/>NOTE: This is one of the more controversial checks,<br/>as it often requires writing new software.<br/>That is sometimes a simple script,<br/>and sometimes complex software requiring many person-months of development. | [`no_generated_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_generated_files.nim) |
| no_global_links_to_local_files | No global links to local files | 0.40 | 0.80 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 0.80 | Checks no links to project local files use a 'global' prefix,<br/>be it a web-hosting URL or an absolute local path. | This is a step towards a documentation that is:<br/><br/>- locally browsable an editable without internet connection<br/>- showing and linking to the actual, local, correct content | [`no_global_links_to_local_files.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_global_links_to_local_files.nim) |
| no_sources_in_root | No sources in root | 0.10 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 0.00 | Checks that no source files appear in the root dir of the project. <br/>Make sure to put them all into sub-directories, for example `src/`. | Makes the Repo look more clean and more friendly,<br/>especially for non-coding people<br/>that might just wnat to browse or edit the documentation. | [`no_sources_in_root.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_sources_in_root.nim) |
| no_space_in_file_names | No space in file names | 0.40 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.80 | 1.00 | Checks that no file-names in the project contain white-space. | This makes automatic processing of all the projects files<br/>much easier and less error-prone. | [`no_space_in_file_names.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/no_space_in_file_names.nim) |
| okh_file_exists | OKH file exists | 0.70 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 1.00 | Checks that the OKH manifest file - <br/>which contains project meta-data - <br/>exists. | If this is actually a hardware project,<br/>the existence of this file clearly and unmistakingly marks it as such,<br/>both for humans and machines/software.<br/><br/>This is useful when dealing with a lot of projects,<br/>to not waste life- or processing-time,<br/>which likely would still be less exact in its findings. | [`okh_file_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/okh_file_exists.nim) |
| okh_lint | OKH manifest content | 0.70 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Checks that the OKH manifest file - <br/>which contains project meta-data - <br/>contains at least the required properties, <br/>and that all properties use the correct format. | This makes the project much more easily comparable,<br/>both for humans and machines/software.<br/><br/>This is useful when dealing with a lot of projects,<br/>to not waste life- or processing-time,<br/>trying to figure out a certain,<br/>commonly useful set of properties about a project. | [`okh_lint.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/okh_lint.nim) |
| readme_exists | README exists | 0.20 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.10 | 0.50 | Checks that a README file exists in the projects root dir, <br/>using the regex `(?i)^.*README.*$`. | A README file is the main entry point for a human that comes along the project,<br/>and wants to figure out what it is about, and how to use it.<br/><br/>It is targeted at all potential stakeholders of the project,<br/>be it designers, manufacturers, sellers, repairers or users.<br/><br/>We might think of it as the most essential,<br/>basic part of the documentation of the project. | [`readme_exists.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/readme_exists.nim) |
| reuse_lint | REUSE Licensing info | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.30 | 1.00 | Checks that complete SPDX licensing info is given <br/>for all files in the project. <br/>We do this using the Free Software Foundations REUSE tool.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is related to the License exists check. | Copyright and licensing is difficult,<br/>especially when reusing software from different projects<br/>that are released under various different licenses.<br/>[REUSE](https://reuse.software/) was started by<br/>the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) (FSFE)<br/>to provide a set of recommendations to make licensing your Free Software projects easier.<br/>Not only do these recommendations make it easier for you<br/>to declare the licenses under which your works are released,<br/>but they also make it easier for a computer<br/>to understand how your project is licensed.<br/><br/>Propper licensing information may prevent or help in potential legal disputes.<br/>It also helps anyone using your source or derivates of it,<br/>to understand their rights.<br/> | [`reuse_lint.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/reuse_lint.nim) |
| unwanted_files_exist_not | No unwanted files | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.30 | Checks that no unwanted files are part of the project. <br/>These could be backups, caches, IDE/platform specific, and so on. | These files, present in the repo, could cause these issues and inconvieniences:<br/><br/>- potentially inflating the repositories size<br/>- mess up local settings (e.g. local cache paths of an IDE) by one designer<br/>  on an other deginers machine<br/>- make the project appear less clean<br/>- make the project maintainers look like amateurs to seasoned Open Source people<br/>- confuse people, as they are around, yet seem to have no usefulness | [`unwanted_files_exist_not.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/unwanted_files_exist_not.nim) |
| uses_dir_std | Uses dir standard | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.30 | 1.00 | 1.00 | Checks whether the unixish OSH directory standard is used <br/>for a sufficient amount of files and directories in the project, <br/>using the osh-dir-std CLI tool. | 1. to be able to extract meta-data:<br/>    1. easy indexing (and thus finding) of projects<br/>    2. easy comparing of projects<br/>    3. allows to write software tools that deal with project repos<br/>2. find your way around quickly and easily in different projects | [`uses_dir_std.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/uses_dir_std.nim) |
| vcs_public | VCS public | 0.70 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.60 | 0.00 | Checks whether the Version Control System (VCS) <br/>is publicly available, and without requiring authentication. | A public VCS (e.g. a git repo on GitHub) -<br/>while somewhat challenging to use for some people -<br/>currently (May 2023) is the best way to colaboratively work on Open Source projects together.<br/><br/>It allows to track changes in parallel,<br/>to see who did what when and why (if use right).<br/><br/>Without a public VCS, the project develoment is reserved for "the elite" that is allowed access to it,<br/>or alternatively - and maybe even worse - the development is split up and happening in parallel,<br/>without a good way of sharing the fruits of labout of that process.<br/> | [`vcs_public.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/vcs_public.nim) |
| vcs_used | VCS is used | 0.70 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.60 | 0.80 | Checks whether a Version Control System (VCS) <br/>is used to store the projects files, e.g. git, mercurial or pijul. | <br/>## What is a VCS<br/><br/>Version control is a system that maintains a history of changes.<br/>What is packaged into a single, specific change,<br/>(aka commit or patch),<br/>is decided by the people that make the changes.<br/>These changes should be small<br/>and they should form logical units that make sense as a whole,<br/>to the point where it makes no sense to divide them further.<br/>A change might edit any number of files, delete some, and add others.<br/>In the VCS, each change comes complete with a summary,<br/>optional extensive description of the changes,<br/>author info, timestamp and other details.<br/>Thus, the VCS can tell you who changed what, when and why,<br/>and it allows you to go back in time,<br/>or create a new mix of changes:<br/>an alternative history.<br/>A specific change may also be marked as a version,<br/>like '2.0' or '1.5.3-alpha'.<br/><br/>## What is it good for<br/><br/>To share the product documentation on versioning systems<br/>is the most efficient, quality-rich way<br/>to work in parallel within a distributed community.<br/><br/>Having the complete history<br/>enables going back to previous versions<br/>to help in root cause analysis for bugs<br/>and it is crucial when needing to fix problems in older versions.<br/><br/>It allows also to connect reported bugs and project management software<br/>to the relevant change(s),<br/>which allows to see whether a particular version<br/>contains a specific fix of a bug or feature.<br/><br/>Textual documentation can be edited online.<br/> | [`vcs_used.nim`](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool/blob/master/src/checks/vcs_used.nim) |

<td>Checks that the content of all Markdown files in the repository<br/>adheres to a strict set of syntax rules for that format.</td>
<td>Markdown exists in many different varieties.<br/>There is mostly one original format (simply: “Markdown”),<br/>which has very loose syntax rules,<br/>and which nobody uses anymore,<br/>because it can be unclear what was meant to be expressed<br/>(format wise).<br/>Then there are all the derivatives,<br/>which are not fully compatible amongst each other.<br/>Examples for these are:<br/><br/>* CommonMark (Close)<br/>* Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)<br/>* GitLab Markdown (very similar to the above)<br/>* Pandoc Markdown<br/><br/>CommonMark has the same, limited set of features like the original Markdown,<br/>but is very strict with regards to what is valid and what not.<br/>This is good, because it means, that if you adhere to this set of rules,<br/><strong>your Markdown will be correctly interpreted whereever Markdown is accepted</strong><br/><br/>Most other Markdown flavors -<br/>like the other three above -<br/>have extended the original set of features,<br/>and try to guess what the user wanted to express,<br/>even if they did not use correct syntax.<br/>To rely on this though, makes ones Markdown less portable,<br/>and thus in a way, kind of inflicts a soft lock-in<br/>on systems supporting such heuristics.</td>

<td>Checks whether a Version Control System (VCS) <br/>is used to store the projects files, e.g. git, mercurial or pijul.</td>
<td><br/>## What is a VCS<br/><br/>Version control is a system that maintains a history of changes.<br/>What is packaged into a single, specific change,<br/>(aka commit or patch),<br/>is decided by the people that make the changes.<br/>These changes should be small<br/>and they should form logical units that make sense as a whole,<br/>to the point where it makes no sense to divide them further.<br/>A change might edit any number of files, delete some, and add others.<br/>In the VCS, each change comes complete with a summary,<br/>optional extensive description of the changes,<br/>author info, timestamp and other details.<br/>Thus, the VCS can tell you who changed what, when and why,<br/>and it allows you to go back in time,<br/>or create a new mix of changes:<br/>an alternative history.<br/>A specific change may also be marked as a version,<br/>like ‘2.0’ or ‘1.5.3-alpha’.<br/><br/>## What is it good for<br/><br/>To share the product documentation on versioning systems<br/>is the most efficient, quality-rich way<br/>to work in parallel within a distributed community.<br/><br/>Having the complete history<br/>enables going back to previous versions<br/>to help in root cause analysis for bugs<br/>and it is crucial when needing to fix problems in older versions.<br/><br/>It allows also to connect reported bugs and project management software<br/>to the relevant change(s),<br/>which allows to see whether a particular version<br/>contains a specific fix of a bug or feature.<br/><br/>Textual documentation can be edited online.<br/></td>

<td>A public VCS (e.g. a git repo on GitHub) -<br/>while somewhat challenging to use for some people -<br/>currently (May 2023) is the best way to colaboratively work on Open Source projects together.<br/><br/>It allows to track changes in parallel,<br/>to see who did what when and why (if use right).<br/><br/>Without a public VCS, the project develoment is reserved for “the elite” that is allowed access to it,<br/>or alternatively - and maybe even worse - the development is split up and happening in parallel,<br/>without a good way of sharing the fruits of labout of that process.<br/></td>

There are no outdated generated files,<br/> because of either of these two reasons:<br/><br/> - One only gets the files hwen generating them right when required, or<br/> - They are regenerated in CI/build-bot and uploaded/hosted on the project pages<br/> whenever there is a change (e.g. a git push to to the repo)<br/><br/>NOTE: This is one of the more controversial checks,<br/>as it often requires writing new software.<br/>That is sometimes a simple script,<br/>and sometimes complex software requiring many person-months of development.</td>
